# Simple Markdown Parser
This is a Rust library that parses Markdown text, covering essential Markdown syntax elements such as headers, lists, emphasis, links, code blocks, and more. It parses Markdown into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), making it easier to manipulate, transform, or render Markdown content in various formats.

Features
* Headers - Parses Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) into structured nodes in the AST.
* Lists - Supports both ordered (`1. Item`) and unordered (`- Item` or `* Item`) lists.
* Emphasis - Recognizes *italic* and **bold** text, along with other emphasis markers.
* Links - Parses inline links (`[text](url)`) and reference links.
* Code Blocks - Detects inline code (`code`) and fenced code blocks.
* Blockquotes - Parses quoted text (`> Quote`) as distinct elements.
* Images - Recognizes inline images (`![alt text](url)`).

The parser processes Markdown into an Abstract Syntax Tree, which can be used for rendering Markdown as HTML, analyzing document structure, or exporting to other formats or editing a markdown file.
